This file just contains some notes to myself about various things.

Checklist for making a new release:

- Run test suite on as many machines as possible.
- Make sure debugging output is turned off.
- Update the version number to the new M.m.r value.
  - README.rst
  - _version.py
- Read over the CHANGELOG.rst file and edit as needed.
- Update the wiki pages to incorporate any changes as needed.
- Update any docs that might need updating.
- In docs directory, run update_docs
- In gh-pages directory, commit and push new docs.
- git tag -a vM.m.r -m MESSAGE
- git push --tags
- python setup.py install  (make sure this is current)
- python setup.py sdist upload
- From another directory try out pip install TreeCorr --upgrade

- git push -u origin releases/M.m
- Back in master, update version number to M.(m+1) (i.e. no .r)
