Three-point Correlation Functions
=================================

There are currently 3 differenct classes for calculating the different possible three-point
auto-correlation functions:

.. toctree::

    nnn
    ggg
    kkk

There are plans to add the various cross-correlations, but they have not yet been implemented.

Each of the above classes is a sub-class of the base class BinnedCorr3, so they have a number of
features in common about how they are constructed.  The common features are documented here.
