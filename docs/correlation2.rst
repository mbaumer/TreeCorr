Two-point Correlation Functions
===============================

There are 6 differenct classes for calculating the different possible two-point correlation
functions:

.. toctree::

    nn
    gg
    ng
    kk
    nk
    kg

Each of the above classes is a sub-class of the base class BinnedCorr2, so they have a number of
features in common about how they are constructed.  The common features are documented here.
